Renewable Energy EV Hub
# [Renewable Energy Data Analyst: PikaSpark]


## Introduction:
This project was in the renewable energy field where I had the opportunity to work with PikaSpark Energy Solutions, a forward-thinking company dedicated to advancing the electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure. In this project, I was tasked with analyzing data to determine the optimal location for an EV Hub, a dedicated forecourt for electric vehicles, and the appropriate number of EV chargers to install. By leveraging demand data, traffic analysis, and cost considerations, I aimed to provide data-driven recommendations to maximize return on investment and support the transition to a greener future.

## Objective:
The primary objective of this project was to recommend the ideal location for an EV Hub and determine the optimal number of EV chargers to be installed to meet customer demand effectively. Specifically, my tasks were to:

Analyze demand data to demonstrate the viability of investing in EV Hubs and forecast future demand trends.
Calculate the expected daily customers for potential holiday destination and motorway locations based on traffic data and customer usage percentages.
Determine the optimal number of EV chargers needed at the forecourt for the shortlisted locations, considering customer charging times and operating hours.
Estimate the time required to recoup the initial investment based on profit estimates and cost data.
Provide a data-driven recommendation on the optimal holiday destination and motorway location for the EV Hub, supported by comprehensive analysis and justification.

## Scenario:
In the role of a data analyst at PikaSpark Energy Solutions, I was tasked with optimizing the establishment of an EV Hub to facilitate the growing demand for electric vehicles. With Â£2 million earmarked for this initiative, the challenge lies in selecting the most strategic location and ensuring sufficient infrastructure to meet customer needs while maximizing profitability.

To address this challenge, I delved into historical demand data for EVs to highlight the increasing adoption of electric vehicles and demonstrate the potential return on investment for EV Hubs. Additionally, I analyzed traffic data to estimate the expected daily customers for holiday destinations and motorways, considering the percentage of cars likely to utilize the EV Hubs.

Using cost data and profit estimates, I determined the optimal number of EV chargers required at the forecourt to balance capacity with demand effectively. By calculating the time needed to recover the initial investment, I provided insights into the financial viability of the proposed EV Hub.

Finally, leveraging all available information, I presented a data-driven recommendation on the optimal holiday destination and motorway location for the EV Hub, emphasizing the merits of each option and justifying my suggestion based on thorough analysis and evidence.

Through this project, my goal was to support PikaSpark Energy Solutions in making informed decisions that not only drive profitability but also contribute to the advancement of sustainable transportation solutions in line with the global shift towards a greener future.
